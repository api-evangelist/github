      The GitHub App API is the set of REST/GraphQL endpoints and webhooks that
      lets a GitHub App securely integrate with and automate work across GitHub.
      Apps authenticate with a shortlived JSON Web Token and exchange it for
      installation access tokens to act on specific repositories or
      organizations with finegrained, leastprivilege permissions, or use
      user-to-server OAuth to act on behalf of a user when needed. Through the
      API, an app can manage its installations, control which repositories it
      has access to, and read/write resources like issues, pull requests,
      commits, checks, deployments, and releases, as well as report status and
      check results. Webhooks deliver event payloads (for example, pushes and PR
      activity) so the app can react in real time, and app manifests enable
      streamlined, oneclick setup. In short, it provides the permissionscoped
      surface for building secure bots, CI/CD integrations, and other
      automations on GitHub.

      The GitHub Authorization (OAuth Authorizations) API historically let you
      programmatically create, list, inspect, and revoke access tokens for a
      user or OAuth applicationsetting scopes, verifying token validity,
      rotating or deleting tokens, and generally managing what an app could do
      on a users behalf. It was commonly used with basic authentication (and
      2FA) to mint personal access tokens and to manage OAuth app grants. For
      security reasons, these endpoints have been deprecated and disabled on
      GitHub.com; today, apps should use modern authorization flows (OAuth web
      or device flow) or GitHub Apps with finegrained permissions, and manage
      personal access tokens via the web UI or the current OAuth application
      endpoints for token verification and revocation.

      emoji shortcodes (like "smile" or "octocat") to the image URLs GitHub uses

      custom ones, enabling clients to power emoji pickers, autocomplete for
      :shortcodes:, validation, or server-side rendering in apps that mirror
      GitHubs formatting. The endpoint is public and requires no auth, but
      using authentication increases rate limits; results change infrequently,

      organization, or user account. It covers many event typessuch as pushes,
      pull requests, issues, comments, releases, stars, forks, and membership
      changeseach with consistent metadata (actor, repo, type, payload,
      timestamps, IDs). Endpoints like /events, /repos/{owner}/{repo}/events,
      /orgs/{org}/events, and user/received variants let you scope activity, and
      authenticated calls include private events youre authorized to view. Its
      useful for dashboards, analytics, and lightweight monitoring, but its not
      a streaming feed: events are transient, must be paginated and polled, are
      rate-limited, and arent guaranteed to be complete over long periods. For
      real-time reaction to changes, GitHub recommends Webhooks; for historical

      The GitHub Installation API is part of the GitHub Apps platform and lets
      an app understand and manage where its installed and what it can access,
      and act on behalf of that installation. Using these endpoints, an app can
      list its installations, fetch details for a specific installation,
      enumerate the repositories granted to it, and (when the app is configured
      for selected repositories) add or remove repository access. Critically,
      it allows the app to exchange its JWT for shortlived installation access
      tokens that carry the installations permissions and repository scope;
      those tokens are then used to call GitHubs REST or GraphQL APIs or to
      perform Git operations over HTTPS. All actions are constrained by the
      permissions defined in the apps manifest and the repositories selected at
      install time, ensuring leastprivilege access. In short, this API is how a
      GitHub App securely discovers its tenants (user/org accounts), scopes its
      access, and performs work on their repositories without acting as an end
      user.

      resources, giving you control over a repos lifecycle and configuration.
      You can list and search repositories for users or organizations; retrieve
      metadata (visibility, default branch, license), topics, and languages;
      manage collaborators, teams, and permissions; create, archive, transfer,
      fork, star, and watch; manage branches and branch protection rules, tags,
      releases and assets; read and write repository contents (files,
      directories, blobs), commits, and compares; configure webhooks and deploy
      keys; and access traffic, vulnerabilities, and community health metrics.
      It uses token-based authentication with scopes (such as repo) and is
      rate-limited, making it suitable for automation, dashboards, and CI/CD
      integrations.

      GitHubs SCIM API implements the SCIM 2.0 standard to automate user
      lifecycle management from an identity provider (such as Entra ID/Azure AD,
      Okta, or OneLogin) to GitHub Enterprise Cloud. It lets you provision,
      update, suspend/reactivate, and deprovision users, keeping their GitHub
      access in sync with your IdP. For organizations that use SAML SSO, SCIM
      manages external identities and org membership; for enterprises using
      Enterprise Managed Users, it creates and maintains the managed user
      accounts themselves. Typical operations include creating users, updating
      profile attributes, and setting a users active state to revoke or restore
      access. SCIM complements SSO (authentication) by handling authorization
      and account lifecycle; it doesnt manage repositories or granular
      permissions beyond controlling whether a user exists and has access to the
      org or enterprise.

      The GitHub Search API lets you programmatically find and filter content
      across GitHubincluding repositories, code, issues and pull requests,
      commits, users, topics, and labelsusing a powerful query language with
      qualifiers (for example by language, stars, forks, org/user,
      path/filename, label, state, author, or committer). It returns ranked,
      paginated JSON results with total counts and optional sorting, so you can
      discover projects, locate code snippets, triage issues, or audit activity
      at scale. Authenticated requests enjoy higher rate limits and can search
      private resources the token can access, and the API returns only the first
      1,000 matching results for any query.

      The GitHub Setup API is the administrative interface for GitHub Enterprise
      Server that lets you automate tasks normally done in the Management
      Console during first-time and ongoing configuration. It provides endpoints
      to upload and apply your license, set the hostname and TLS certificates,
      configure system services like SMTP, create or reset the initial admin
      credentials, start and monitor reconfiguration runs, and query setup
      status and health. This API is intended for bootstrapping and repeatable
      provisioning (for example, cloud deployment or disaster recovery) and is
      restricted to authorized administrators. It is separate from the public
      GitHub REST and GraphQL APIs used for repositories, issues, and other
      developer workflows.

      The GitHub Teams API lets you programmatically manage organization teams

      teams; organize parent/child team hierarchies; add or remove members and
      maintainers; send and manage invitations; and list or audit team
      membership. It also lets you grant, adjust, or revoke a teams permissions
      to repositories (and, where applicable, projects), enabling consistent,
      leastprivilege access control at scale. For enterprise setups, it
      supports syncing teams with external identity provider groups. These
      capabilities are available via REST and GraphQL, and require appropriate
      organization admin or team maintainer permissions and token scopes.

      The GitHub Zen API is a playful REST endpoint that returns a random
      aphorism from the Zen of GitHub, such as Keep it logically awesome.
      Each request to GET https://api.github.com/zen responds with a single
      plain-text line, making it useful for quick connectivity checks, demoing
      HTTP calls, or verifying authentication. It doesnt require auth, but you
      can include a token to benefit from higher rate limits. Because it returns
      just a simple string with minimal structure, it serves as a lightweight
      sanity check and a fun Easter egg within the GitHub API.

      The GitHub Users API (part of the REST API) lets applications read and,
      for the authenticated account, manage user-related data on GitHub. It can
      fetch public profiles for any user or the authenticated users private
      profile details, list a users public repositories and organizations, and
      view activity like followers and following. For the signed-in user it also
      supports actions such as updating profile metadata, following or
      unfollowing users, blocking users, and managing account artifacts like
      emails, SSH/GPG/signing keys, and linked social accounts. Endpoints honor
      pagination and conditional requests, and access to private data or write
      operations requires authentication with appropriate token scopes. This
      makes it useful for building integrations that personalize experiences,
      synchronize account data, or automate account settings.
