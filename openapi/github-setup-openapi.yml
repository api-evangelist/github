  title: GitHub Setup API
  description: >-
    The GitHub Setup APIs provide endpoints for configuring and managing the
    initial setup and administrative settings of GitHub Enterprise Server
    instances. These APIs allow system administrators to programmatically
    control enterprise-level configurations such as authentication settings,
    license management, maintenance mode operations, server statistics and
    health checks, and other foundational setup tasks required to deploy and
    maintain a GitHub Enterprise Server installation. This API is primarily used
    by DevOps teams and system administrators to automate GitHub Enterprise
    Server deployments, integrate server management into infrastructure-as-code
    workflows, monitor server health and performance, and ensure consistent
    configuration across multiple enterprise instances.

        This endpoint allows you to check the status of the most recent
        configuration process:


        Note that you may need to wait several seconds after you start a process
        before you can check its status.


        The different statuses are:


        | Status        | Description                       |

        | - |  |

        | `PENDING`     | The job has not started yet       |

        | `CONFIGURING` | The job is running                |

        | `DONE`        | The job has finished correctly    |

        | `FAILED`      | The job has finished unexpectedly |

        The GitHub Setup API's `/setup/api/configure` endpoint accepts POST
        requests to initiate the configuration process for a new GitHub
        Enterprise Server instance. This endpoint is typically called during the
        initial setup phase when administrators need to establish basic system
        settings such as management console password, hostname, and other
        foundational configurations. The API operation triggers the
        configuration workflow that prepares the instance for use, and it
        returns a response indicating whether the configuration process has
        successfully started or if any errors occurred during initialization.

        The GitHub Setup API endpoint `/setup/api/maintenance` using the GET
        method retrieves the current maintenance status of a GitHub Enterprise
        Server instance. This operation allows administrators and monitoring
        systems to programmatically check whether the server is currently in
        maintenance mode, which is useful for coordinating deployments,
        upgrades, or troubleshooting activities. The endpoint returns
        information about the maintenance state, helping teams understand if the
        instance is available for normal operations or if maintenance procedures
        are currently active, enabling better orchestration of administrative
        tasks and communication with users about system availability.

      summary: Create Github License
      description: >-
        When you boot a GitHub instance for the first time, you can use the
        following endpoint to upload a license.


        Note that you need to `POST` to
        [`/setup/api/configure`](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@3.9/rest/enterprise-admin/management-console#start-a-configuration-process)
        to start the actual configuration process.


        When using this endpoint, your GitHub instance must have a password set.
        This can be accomplished two ways:


        1.  If you're working directly with the API before accessing the web
        interface, you must pass in the password parameter to set your password.

        2.  If you set up your instance via the web interface before accessing
        the API, your calls to this endpoint do not need the password parameter.


        **Note:** The request body for this operation must be submitted as
        `multipart/form-data` data. You can can reference the license file by
        prefixing the filename with the `@` symbol using `curl`. For more
        information, see the [`curl`
        documentation](https://curl.se/docs/manpage.html#-F).

                    password through the web interface, you don't need this
