  title: GitHub Teams API
  description: >-
    The GitHub Teams API allows developers to programmatically create and manage
    teams within GitHub organizations, which are groups of organization members
    that reflect your company or group's structure and provide cascading access
    permissions to repositories. Through these REST API endpoints, you can
    create and delete teams, add or remove team members and maintainers, manage
    team repositories and their permission levels, organize teams into
    hierarchical structures with parent and child teams, configure team settings
    like privacy levels and notifications, and access team discussions. This API
    is essential for automating team management workflows, synchronizing GitHub
    team structures with external HR or directory systems, building custom
    administrative dashboards, and maintaining consistent access control as your
    organization scales.

        The List Teams operation retrieves all teams within a specified GitHub
        organization using a GET request to the /orgs/{org}/teams endpoint. This
        API call returns an array of team objects containing details such as
        team name, ID, slug, description, privacy level, and permission
        settings. Authentication is required with appropriate OAuth scopes or
        personal access tokens that grant read access to the organization. The
        response can be paginated using standard GitHub pagination parameters,
        and the results may be filtered based on the authenticated user's
        permissions within the organization. This endpoint is commonly used by
        organization administrators and applications that need to enumerate
        teams for management, reporting, or integration purposes.

        Adds an organization member to a team. An authenticated organization
        owner or team maintainer can add organization members to a team.


        Team synchronization is available for organizations using GitHub
        Enterprise Cloud. For more information, see [GitHub's
        products](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@3.9/github/getting-started-with-github/githubs-products)
        in the GitHub Help documentation.


        **Note:** When you have team synchronization set up for a team with your
        organization's identity provider (IdP), you will see an error if you
        attempt to use the API for making changes to the team's membership. If
        you have access to manage group membership in your IdP, you can manage
        GitHub Enterprise Server team membership through your identity provider,
        which automatically adds and removes team members in an organization.
        For more information, see "[Synchronizing teams between your identity
        provider and GitHub Enterprise
        Server](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@3.9/articles/synchronizing-teams-between-your-identity-provider-and-github/)."


        An organization owner can add someone who is not part of the team's
        organization to a team. When an organization owner adds someone to a
        team who is not an organization member, this endpoint will send an
        invitation to the person via email. This newly-created membership will
        be in the "pending" state until the person accepts the invitation, at
        which point the membership will transition to the "active" state and the
        user will be added as a member of the team.


        If the user is already a member of the team, this endpoint will update
        the role of the team member's role. To update the membership of a team
        member, the authenticated user must be an organization owner or a team
        maintainer.


        **Note:** You can also specify a team by `org_id` and `team_id` using
        the route `PUT
        /organizations/{org_id}/team/{team_id}/memberships/{username}`.

        You can also get information about the specified repository, including
        what permissions the team grants on it, by passing the following custom
        [media
        type](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@3.9/rest/overview/media-types/)
        via the `application/vnd.github.v3.repository+json` accept header.


        If a team doesn't have permission for the repository, you will receive a
        `404 Not Found` response status.


        If the repository is private, you must have at least `read` permission
        for that repository, and your token must have the `repo` or `admin:org`
        scope. Otherwise, you will receive a `404 Not Found` response status.


        **Note:** You can also specify a team by `org_id` and `team_id` using
        the route `GET
        /organizations/{org_id}/team/{team_id}/repos/{owner}/{repo}`.

        Team synchronization is available for organizations using GitHub

        in the GitHub Help documentation.


        To add someone to a team, the authenticated user must be an organization
        owner or a team maintainer in the team they're changing. The person
        being added to the team must be a member of the team's organization.


        **Note:** When you have team synchronization set up for a team with your
        organization's identity provider (IdP), you will see an error if you
        attempt to use the API for making changes to the team's membership. If
        you have access to manage group membership in your IdP, you can manage
        GitHub Enterprise Server team membership through your identity provider,
        which automatically adds and removes team members in an organization.

        If the user is unaffiliated with the team's organization, this endpoint

        invitation, at which point the membership will transition to the
        "active" state and the user will be added as a member of the team. To
        add a membership between an unaffiliated user and a team, the
        authenticated user must be an organization owner.


        If the user is already a member of the team, this endpoint will update

            # Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct


            ## Our Pledge


            In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we
            as contributors and maintainers pledge to making participation in
            our project and our community a harassment-free experience for
            everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity,
            gender identity and expression, level of experience, nationality,
            personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and
            orientation.


            ## Our Standards


            Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive
            environment include:


            * Using welcoming and inclusive language

            * Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences

            * Gracefully accepting constructive criticism

            * Focusing on what is best for the community

            * Showing empathy towards other community members


            Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:


            * The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual
            attention or advances

            * Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political
            attacks

            * Public or private harassment

            * Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or
            electronic address, without explicit permission

            * Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate
            in a professional setting


            ## Our Responsibilities


            Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of
            acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair
            corrective action in response
                              to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

            Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove,
            edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and
            other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or
            to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for other
            behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or
            harmful.


            ## Scope


            This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in
            public spaces when an individual is representing the project or its
            community. Examples of representing a project or community include
            using an official project e-mail address,
                              posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event. Representation of a project may be further defined and clarified by project maintainers.

            ## Enforcement


            Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior
            may be reported by contacting the project team at [EMAIL]. The
            project team will review and investigate all complaints, and will
            respond in a way that it deems appropriate to the circumstances. The
            project team is obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to
            the reporter of an incident. Further details of specific enforcement
            policies may be posted separately.


            Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct
            in good faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as
            determined by other members of the project's leadership.
