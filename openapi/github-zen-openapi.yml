  title: GitHub Zen API
  description: >-
    The GitHub Zen API is a simple, lighthearted endpoint that returns a random
    piece of philosophical or inspirational wisdom from GitHub's design
    philosophy when called. This playful API serves no functional purpose in
    application development but instead offers a moment of reflection, often
    sharing pithy sayings about software development, collaboration, or design
    principles that embody GitHub's cultural values. Developers sometimes use it
    as a simple test endpoint to verify API connectivity, as an Easter egg in
    applications, or simply to get a bit of inspiration during their coding
    sessions—it's GitHub's way of adding a human touch to their technical
    platform.
